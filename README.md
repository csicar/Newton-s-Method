Newton-s-Method
===============

A interactive site that can visualize the newton's method

Interesting Demos
---

Since the Newton's Method can be konvergent, divergent or oszilerating there are demos to show that.

###Konvergent

`f(x) = sin(x)` `x_0 = 1.1`

###Divergent

`f(x) = e^x` `x_0=1.1`

###Oszilatation

`f(x) = `

###Another point

`f(x) = sin(x)` `x_0 = 1.2`
